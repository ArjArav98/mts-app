# MTS App

The MTS app is a mobile application, built using React Native, that will be used by customers at supermarkets to add items to their cart virtually. This app has been built with the Coronavirus in mind. Customers will not have to touch an item. Rather, they will scan a barcode on the item and the item will be added to the cart in their app. They can change the quantity of the item inside the app as well.

Once they are finished, a QR code for the bill will be generated. This will then have to be shown to the salesperson at the supermarket counter who will initiate a payment request outside the application.

Work in progress.
